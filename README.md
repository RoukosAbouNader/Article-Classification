# NLP Final Project

This repository contains the **NLP Final Project** notebook.

## Project Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on a text classification task using the AG News dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, training different classification models, and evaluating their performance.


## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Hugging Face Datasets

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn datasets
   ```
4. Run all cells in the notebook sequentially.
